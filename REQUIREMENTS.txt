
External Requirements for Music Player

These are the external packages and software needed to make the music player work.
They are all free to download and use and should be compatible with most if not all systems.

Side Note: I have no idea why this file is colored weirdly I thnk its something to do with the file being called "REQUIREMENTS" but I dont know.
It may also just be something on VS Codes end so if it looks normal to you just ignore this side note lol.
